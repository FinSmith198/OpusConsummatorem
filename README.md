## What is This?

This is A Discord bot written in Java, designed to be a fun bot, with not many practical uses.
Use it however you wish. To run, put in your bot token into the default.conf file, 
and build and run it with the build.sh script (only works on linux, make sure you have the most recent java JDK installed).
